# Privacy Policy

**Capture — by Patrick Jackson**

*Last updated: February 28, 2026*

## Overview

Capture is a mobile application for quickly capturing notes, images, and files on your Android device. Your privacy is important, and this policy explains how the app handles your data.

## Data Collection

Capture does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All captured content (text, images, files) is stored locally on your device.

## Third-Party Services

Capture does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. No data is shared with third parties.

## Permissions

Capture may request the following device permissions:

- **Storage** — to save captured files locally on your device
- **Share sheet / intent filters** — to receive content shared from other apps

These permissions are used solely to provide core app functionality. No data accessed through these permissions leaves your device.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device. Capture does not use cloud storage, remote databases, or any form of server-side data storage.

## Children's Privacy

Capture does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. Since the app does not collect personal data from any user, it is safe for use by all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the revised version will be posted here with an updated date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
